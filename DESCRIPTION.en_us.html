    Grandiflora, or in its original language, Neungsohwa is a decorative Hangeul typeface inspired by the Art Nouveau style of the 20th century. It is presented exclusively in hairline weight to highlight the elegant curves and ornamental characteristics of Hangeul. As Art Nouveau is commonly represented by vines and florals, the typeface was named after the most beloved summer vines of Korea, Campsis grandiflora (Neungsohwa).

    JAMO is a type design collective group based in Seoul, Korea. We provide professional education, information, and discussion to designers who are wishing to develop their own typefaces through our workshop. JAMO encourages more experimental and unconventional typeface design by getting inspirations from old types, finding an alternative usage from existing ones, and suggesting new letterforms for the future. We aim to escape from the passive practice and create more self-initiating active typefaces. JAMO offers high-quality typeface design based on the deep levels of research, planning, and study. By broadening the potential of Hangul, we propose a new type design methodology to co-live with other worldwide letters including the Latin Alphabet.
