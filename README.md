Grandiflora, or in its original language, Neungsohwa(능소화) is a decorative Hangeul typeface inspired by the Art Nouveau style of the 20th century. It is presented exclusively in hairline weight to highlight the elegant curves and ornamental characteristics of Hangeul. As Art Nouveau is commonly represented by vines and florals, the typeface was named after the most beloved summer vines of Korea, Campsis grandiflora (Neungsohwa).

It is designed mainly for Hangeul typography, but it also includes GF Latin. An additional set of stylistic Latin and alternative glyphs with swashes are also featured. Along with basic numbers and symbols, a set of oldstyle numbers and 72 typographic ornaments are included.
